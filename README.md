# DAP-client

This is a python tool providing client API support for the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) - https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/.
The code currently contains a Jupyter notebook based demo of how we can leverage DAP to debug any python program.
For the debug server, we use the Python Tools for Visual Studio debug server (ptvsd) - https://github.com/microsoft/ptvsd
Follow the instructions on the debug_server.ipynb to start the process with the debug server on and then go through the client_class.ipynb for the client API and a tutorial for an example of its application.
